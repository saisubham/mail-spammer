# mail-spammer
Send mail from Java spring boot application

## Changes before running:
- :writing_hand: `src/main/resources/application.properties` : change host, username & password
- :writing_hand: `src/test/java/com/sudosai/maildemo/MailServiceTest.java` : set sender, receivers, subject and content.
- :smiling_imp: make a loop in test file and spam.

## TODO
- [ ] Make a GUI
- [ ] Support POP, IMAP (Have to study these. Maybe it is built in? idk)
- [ ] Support markdown editor for spam
